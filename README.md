# Learning-Node
NodeJS is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser, built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It enables server-side development, supports asynchronous, event-driven programming, and efficiently handles scalable network applications.

Key Features of NodeJS:

Server-Side JavaScript: NodeJS allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling backend development.

Asynchronous & Non-Blocking: Uses an event-driven architecture to handle multiple requests without waiting, improving performance.

Single-Threaded Event Loop: Efficiently manages concurrent tasks using a single thread, avoiding thread overhead.

V8 Chrome Engine: High performance, Open-Source Javascript web assembly engine developed by google and rewoned for compiling JS into native machine code to execute it with exceptional speed..

Scalable & Lightweight: Ideal for building microservices and handling high-traffic applications efficiently.

Rich NPM Ecosystem: Access to thousands of open-source libraries through Node Package Manager (NPM) for faster development.
